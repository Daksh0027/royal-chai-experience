# Chai Culture | Royal "Coming Soon" Landing Page

> *"Brew the Royal Tradition"*
## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a premium, mobile responsive "Coming Soon" landing page developed for **Chai Culture**. The goal was to translate the brand's vision of heritage, authenticity, and royal tradition into a digital experience.

The design focuses on warmth and elegance, utilizing a "Royal Brown & Gold" palette to reflect the premium nature of the instant chai premix.

## 🎨 Design Choices & Brand Fit

*In response to the assignment requirements:*

To reflect Chai Culture's **"royal and authentic"** brand identity, I utilized a color palette of **Deep Coffee Brown** and **Metallic Gold**, evoking the richness of premium tea and heritage.

I selected **Playfair Display** (serif) for headings to establish an editorial, high end elegance, paired with **Lato** (sans serif) for modern readability. The layout relies on a centered, symmetrical composition to mimic the stability and grace of traditional royal crests.
